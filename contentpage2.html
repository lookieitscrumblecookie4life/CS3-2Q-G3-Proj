                        <p>
                            The economic instability in Gaza and Sudan is a major factor, causing famine in both regions. In Gaza, years of conflict and restrictions have destroyed the economy and agricultural infrastructure. The recent war has worsened food insecurity, leaving most families dependent on support services. With agricultural production nearly wiped out and food imports limited, people struggle to access even basic necessities. Unemployment is high, and clean water is scarce, adding to the crisis. Support services are often delayed due to political and logistical barriers, leaving millions at risk of starvation. The damage to farmland and water resources has made recovery significantly more challenging, further threatening Gaza's long-term food security (Frontiers, 2024).

                        <p>
                            Sudan faces a similar challenge, worsened by conflict between rival military alliances. This violence has forced millions to flee their homes, disrupted farming, and blocked food sources. Nearly half the population now experiences severe food shortages. Economic instability, rising food prices, and ongoing climate shocks, like floods and droughts, have made recovery nearly impossible. Resources in nearby nations are further taxed by the evacuees leaving Sudan. Without peace and stronger international support, the situation continues to worsen. Long-term solutions are needed to bring stability to the region, end hunger, and prevent further humanitarian crises (FAO-WFP, 2024).
